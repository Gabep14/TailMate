# TailMate

TailMate is an app designed to connect sports fans, concert enthusiasts, cultural festivals, and more through saving and locating nearby tailgates. 


## Background

Tailgating is a popular activity, particularly for sports fans, to meet in parking lots and empty spaces before sporting events. Fans can share food, drinks, fun activities, and even set up TV's to watch the game. Growing up near Detroit, my team and I know how important tailgating is to Detroit sports fans. However, many fans such as myself don't always know where the best tailgate are or how to find them. This is where TailMate comes in, allowing a user to open the app and easily locate nearby tailgates filtered by event, density, and location.
